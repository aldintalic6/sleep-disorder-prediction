# Model for Prediction of Sleep Disorders

## About

This project was focused on developing a prediction model for sleep disorders using different machine learning techniques. The model is trained on a dataset that contains various demographic, health and lifestyle factors, such as age, gender, occupation, sleep duration, quality of sleep, BMI Category, stress level and more. The project involved doing the data preprocessing, data analysis and finally building the actual model. Various models, that were tuned using GridSearchCV to optimize model performance, were developed. Those models are Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN). The final model, that was selected based on the best performance, was used to predict sleep disorders with high accuracy. Additionally, the project includes a feature that allows manual input of user data to predict the likelihood of a sleep disorder based on those inputted attributes.
